### This project was made as part of the Programming 2 course during my second semester.

## Introduction

It's computational implementation of the famous quantum double-slit experiment using Numerical Probability methods, demonstrating wave-particle duality through numerical simulation. The system models the probability distribution of particle impacts on a detection screen after passing through two slits. It also makes an animation of the scattering electrons (SDL). 

### Requirements
- C++ compiler
- SDL2 and SDL2_ttf libraries
